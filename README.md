# Python
This is a repo of my python files and projects that I am working on. Note that the most of the file's from the python_work folder came from Eric Matthes 2nd "Python Crash Course" where he covered the fundamentals of python along with 3 big projects to do in either video games, data visualization or web applications. Also the data visualization project inside python_projects is from the book as well. Note that the turtle race project came from Tech with Tim and the file's in scripting folder came from Al Sweigart "Automate the boring stuff". To make is easier to read my source I will also list them down below.

Python Sources:

	- Al Sweigart
	- Eric Matthes
	- Tim from "Tech with Tim"

I plan on adding projects of my own or from other sources as well. I will try to update this read me accordingly with other sources I stumble across on that I use in this repo.
